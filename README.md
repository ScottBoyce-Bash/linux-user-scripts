# Scott Boyce Personal .bashrc scripts and git settings

These are an archive of the .bashrc and .bash_profile scripts I like to use for bash for windows. A lot of the aliases can also be ported to the linux side. I also include my history as  means of pulling some of mu more complex commands that I use frequently with `ctrl-r` in the bash terminal.

The file `.gitconfig` contains the git settings that I like to use for my person git install.

The file, `git-prompt.sh`, modifies the `PS1` variable to format the terminal the way I like it for git-bash.exe and the vscode terminal. It is normally place in the `${HOME}/.config/git` directory.
